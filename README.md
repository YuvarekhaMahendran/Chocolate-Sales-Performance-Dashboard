# Chocolate-Sales-Performance-Dashboard

Designed an end-to-end business intelligence solution to analyze chocolate sales data and uncover strategic insights related to product performance, regional demand, shipping efficiency, and sales team effectiveness

📊 Project Spotlight: 

Chocolate Sales Performance Dashboard
 From SQL-powered data cleaning to crafting an interactive Power BI experience, this was more than just charts — it was a flavor-packed journey in business analytics.

🔍 Business Problem
 
“How can the chocolate company improve its sales strategy by identifying top-performing products, regions, and salespeople, while optimizing shipment volumes and revenue efficiency?”

💼 What I Worked On

 ✔️ Cleaned messy data with SQL (ever removed $ signs from 1,000+ rows? It’s fun, I promise)
 ✔️ Modeled KPIs to track revenue, orders, boxes shipped & average value
 ✔️ Designed a Power BI dashboard that doesn’t just show numbers — it tells a story

📈 Sweet & Surprising KPI Insights

 🍫 Smooth Silky Sally is the top revenue generator!
 🌍 Australia ships the most boxes — didn't expect that!
 📅 Mondays lead in order volume — maybe chocolate is how people fight Monday blues
 🏆 Ches Bonnell topped the sales leaderboard — stellar performance
 📉 Some products (sorry Orange Cream...) are due for a strategy rethink

💡 What I Learned

 ✨ Data cleaning is the unsung hero of analytics
 ✨ Storytelling makes dashboards meaningful — not just functional
 ✨ Even something as universal as chocolate can hold powerful lessons when viewed through data
